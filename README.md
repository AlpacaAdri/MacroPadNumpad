# MacroPadNumpad
A custom Arduino based numpad made in Kicad.

This repo contains both the KICAD project files for the macropad PCB as well as the Arduino code needed to run it.
This project also uses the MX_Alpas_Hybrid library from https://github.com/ai03-2725/MX_Alps_Hybrid

this is very much a work in progress
